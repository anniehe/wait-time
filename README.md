# NomNow!
NomNow! is a user-driven web app that provides the ability to make informed decisions on choosing a restaurant based on current wait times, popularity, and proximity. Users can search for nearby restaurants or by cuisine and get a map and list of restaurants with the most recent user-reported wait times. Sorting and filtering features allow for more tailored results. Users can also choose to receive text notifications for reminders when their wait time is up, allowing for more control over their time instead of hovering outside a restaurant.
